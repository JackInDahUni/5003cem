Practice and assessed work for university.

Week 1 was for practice and each week after will be assessed work.
Each week there will either be a standard task and/or a advanced task.

Week 4 is a selection sort standard task,
where I define a function with the argument A which is a list that needs to be sorted.

Week 5 part 1 is a standard task,
in the standard task I need to define two method one that iteratively searches for a value in the binary tree,
the second method is the same however done recursively which needs a second method in order to make it work.

Week 5 part 2 is an advanced task,
this is where I have to make a method that can delete a node within the binary tree,
in this method it has 3 cases all together,
the first case has to check if the node has no children,
the second case checks to see if there is only one child,
and the third checks when there is both left and right children using a different method called leftNRight
